# üéì Time Capsule API

## üéØ Objectives
* Creating an API using **Amazon Web Services**
* Create a Role to access database
* Use **DynamoDB database** to create, store and edit new records
* Use **Lambda** and **OpenAPI** to create "GET" and "POST" method


### I- DataBase Setup:
1. [Create a Dynamo DB database table](#1-DynamoDB-NoSQL)
2. [Create records in the table, with id identifier, and Attribute values](#2-creating-items)
3. [Get the ARN](#3-Amazon-Resource-name)

### II- Database Role to Access Database:
1. [Setup IAM & Create a Role](#1-create-a-security-token)
2. [Create a Policy](#2-create-table-genre-with-graphql)
3. [ADD the ARN location](#3-insert-data-in-the-table-with-graphql)

### III- Write Lambda to read the records using GET
1. [Lambda Java](#Write-the-Lambda-code-and-Test-the-program-in-Java-code)

### IV- Create the GET API
1. [GET API](#In-API-module-we-use-the-GET-function-used-to-create-the-GET-API)

### V- Create POST method
1. [Creating Lambda](#Lambda-Code)

### VI- Read records and add to them with Postman
1. [Setup IAM](#Using-Base-URL-to-Read-and-Post-records)


# Part 1 - DataBase Setup

## 1. Create a DynamoDB NoSQL database table
**'DynamoDB'** is a NoSQL database, which allows for creating and keeping records.

## 2. Create records in the table, with id identifier, and Attribute values
**'creating-items'** Crucial events in the History of the wrold with attributes Year,Event,Place and Description
![Items Created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63557848/148151734-3cd6d72d-4e42-4d9e-b74d-6376b1d6e055.png)

## 3. Get the ARN
**'Amazon Resource Name'** Next  we get the ARN(Amazon Resource Name), we will later add the ARN to the system, database cloud ID URL

# Part 2 - Database Role to Access Database

## 1. Setup IAM & Create a Role
**'History Role'** We use the ARN created before to set up a Role which will be used to create the Policy and the GET and POST methods

## 2. Create a Policy
**'History Role'** We use the ARN created before to set up a Role which will be used to create the Policy and the GET and POST methods
![Creating Policy for the History Role created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63557848/148155474-32321272-c6b9-4cbf-a58f-a4c154986157.png)
 
## 3. Add the ARN location
**'History Role'** Adding the ARN to tell the system where the resources are located

# Part 3 - Write Lambda to read the records using GET
**'Lambda Code'** First we bring in the AWS library code that is the Amazon Web Services software development kit. We‚Äôre going to use that code later on; next we‚Äôre going to use a handler that‚Äôs going to handle the ‚Äúevent‚Äù that comes in, the event being an HTTP request. it‚Äôs going to provide that information in the form of an event, that is what‚Äôs being sent, as well as context(The information about the event)
Next we contact the Dynamo Database using there‚Äôs an specific API version to not worry about the updates.
We create the path parameter as well as the other parameters, and we‚Äôre gonna use the key to get the Year id.
Next we‚Äôre going to use the parameters and the GET function from Amazon library to GET the info.
We‚Äôre gonna get the response ‚Äò200 OK‚Äô .
Finally we‚Äôre gonna put the data response in JSON format and return the response.

After getting the '200 OK' green light, we deploy the Lambda.
